# SLP Parser

slp-parser is a JavaScript Library for parsing [Simple Ledger Protocol (SLP)](https://github.com/simpleledger/slp-specifications) metadata. TokenType1 and NFT1 tokens are supported. This repo is designed to be easy to port to other languages.

# Installation

#### For node.js
```bash
npm install slp-parser
```

#### For browser
```html
<script src='https://unpkg.com/slp-parser'></script>
```


# Examples

This library does not perform any validation of the inputs, dealing solely with parsing the OP_RETURN messages SLP uses to function. If this is not clear, please read the [slp-specifications](https://github.com/simpleledger/slp-specifications).

NOTES: 

* The [BigNumber.js library](https://github.com/MikeMcl/bignumber.js) is used to avoid precision issues with numbers having more than 15 significant digits. This can be accessed with `slpParser.BN`.

## How to parse

This library has a single method called `parseSLP` which takes either a Buffer or a hex-string and returns an object such as described with the type definitions inside `./lib/index.ts`.

There are additional examples in `examples` folder.


### Node.js
```js
const slpParser = require('slp-parser');
const obj = slpParser.parseSLP(Buffer.from('6a04534c500001010747454e455349534c004c004c004c0001004c00080000000000000064', 'hex'));
console.log(obj);
```

### Web
